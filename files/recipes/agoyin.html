		  <h2 class="sub-header">Description</h2>
		  
		  <p class="sub-text">Ewa Agoyin is a popular and flavorful Nigerian street food dish that hails from the Yoruba culture. It consists of mashed beans, typically served with a rich and spicy stew made from palm oil, onions, and chili peppers. The name "Ewa Agoyin" is derived from the Yoruba language, with "Ewa" meaning beans and "Agoyin" referring to the Agoyin people of Benin, who are known for their mastery of this dish.

		  The beans are boiled until tender, then mashed into a thick, lumpy consistency, creating a satisfying and hearty base for the dish. The real star of Ewa Agoyin, however, is the fiery and flavorful sauce. Palm oil is used to prepare a stew with caramelized onions and a blend of aromatic spices and peppers. This sauce is generously poured over the mashed beans, creating a mouthwatering combination of textures and tastes. Ewa Agoyin is often served with fried plantains, fried yams, or soft bread rolls, making it a beloved and indulgent street food delicacy in Nigeria enjoyed for its bold and spicy flavors.</p>

		  <h2 class="sub-header">Steps</h2>
		  <ol class="steps-list">
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Rinse the dried beans thoroughly. Soak them in water for at least 4 hours or overnight to soften. Drain and rinse the soaked beans</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">In a large pot, add the soaked and rinsed beans. Add enough water to cover the beans and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the beans are tender but not mushy. This can take about 30-45 minutes. Add more water if needed during cooking. Once done, drain the cooked beans and set them aside. </li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Chop some of the onions and chili peppers (adjust the amount based on your desired spice level). In a separate pot or saucepan, heat the palm oil until it becomes clear and slightly translucent (be careful not to overheat and burn the oil). Add the chopped onions and chili peppers to the hot palm oil and saut√© until the onions become caramelized and the peppers release their flavors.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Add ground crayfish, garlic, ginger, and any other seasonings you prefer (bouillon cubes, salt, etc.). Stir well to combine.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Take the drained beans and use a potato masher or the back of a spoon to mash them into a thick, lumpy consistency. Some people prefer it smoother, so adjust to your preference.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Pour the spicy palm oil sauce over the mashed beans.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Mix the sauce and mashed beans thoroughly, ensuring they are well combined. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a bit of water to achieve your desired consistency. Simmer the mixture on low heat for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
