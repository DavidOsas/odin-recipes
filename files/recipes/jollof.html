		  <h2 class="sub-header">Steps</h2>
		  <ol class="steps-list">
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Blend together fresh tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, habanero peppers, garlic, and ginger to create a smooth tomato sauce. Adjust the quantity of peppers based on your desired spice level.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat some vegetable oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent.Add the blended tomato sauce and cook, stirring frequently, until it thickens and the oil starts to separate. This step can take about 20-30 minutes.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Add your choice of spices, including thyme, bay leaves, curry powder, and bouillon cubes. Adjust the seasoning to taste.Add salt to taste and continue to simmer the sauce.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">If you're including protein like chicken, beef, or shrimp, add it to the simmering sauce at this point. Ensure it cooks through and absorbs the flavors.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water to remove excess starch.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Add the rinsed rice to the simmering tomato sauce.Stir well to coat the rice with the sauce. Add enough stock or water to cover the rice (usually about 2 cups of liquid for every cup of rice). Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer gently until it's cooked and the liquid is absorbed. This usually takes 20-30 minutes.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">If you're adding vegetables like peas, carrots, or green beans, you can stir them into the rice during the last 10 minutes of cooking.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Periodically check the rice to ensure it doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pot. If needed, add a bit more liquid and stir.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Once the rice is cooked and the grains are separate, remove the pot from the heat. Let it rest for a few minutes before fluffing the rice with a fork.</li>
