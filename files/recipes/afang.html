    <h2 class="sub-header">Description</h2>
		  
		  <p class="sub-text">Afang soup is a sumptuous and aromatic traditional dish hailing from the Efik and Ibibio people of Southern Nigeria, particularly the Cross River and Akwa Ibom states. This hearty soup is highly regarded for its rich and complex flavors, as well as its nutritional value. At its core, Afang soup features a generous mix of leafy greens, including the African wild spinach (known as "afang" leaves) and waterleaf. These greens are finely sliced and cooked in a flavorful broth made with assorted proteins such as meat, fish, or seafood. What truly sets Afang soup apart is the use of ground crayfish, periwinkle, palm oil, and a blend of traditional spices like utazi leaves and pepper, which infuse the dish with a distinctive taste and aroma. <br><br>The preparation of Afang soup is a labor of love, as it involves meticulous slicing of the greens and the gradual incorporation of ingredients to achieve the desired consistency and flavor. Traditionally served with a staple like fufu or pounded yam, Afang soup represents a culinary tradition that celebrates the bountiful produce of Southern Nigeria and the communal joy of sharing a nourishing and delicious meal with loved ones. It stands as a symbol of cultural heritage and a testament to the diverse and vibrant food culture of West Africa.</p>
