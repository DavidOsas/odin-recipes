    <h2 class="sub-header">Description</h2>
		  
		  <p class="sub-text">Afang soup is a sumptuous and aromatic traditional dish hailing from the Efik and Ibibio people of Southern Nigeria, particularly the Cross River and Akwa Ibom states. This hearty soup is highly regarded for its rich and complex flavors, as well as its nutritional value. At its core, Afang soup features a generous mix of leafy greens, including the African wild spinach (known as "afang" leaves) and waterleaf. These greens are finely sliced and cooked in a flavorful broth made with assorted proteins such as meat, fish, or seafood. What truly sets Afang soup apart is the use of ground crayfish, periwinkle, palm oil, and a blend of traditional spices like utazi leaves and pepper, which infuse the dish with a distinctive taste and aroma. <br><br>The preparation of Afang soup is a labor of love, as it involves meticulous slicing of the greens and the gradual incorporation of ingredients to achieve the desired consistency and flavor. Traditionally served with a staple like fufu or pounded yam, Afang soup represents a culinary tradition that celebrates the bountiful produce of Southern Nigeria and the communal joy of sharing a nourishing and delicious meal with loved ones. It stands as a symbol of cultural heritage and a testament to the diverse and vibrant food culture of West Africa.</p>

		  <h2 class="sub-header">Steps</h2>
		  <ol class="steps-list">
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Wash and season your choice of proteins with onions, garlic, ginger, bouillon cubes, and salt. Cook the proteins until they are tender. This can be done by boiling, frying, or a combination of both, depending on your preference. Set the cooked proteins aside.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Wash the afang leaves and waterleaf (or spinach) thoroughly. Slice the afang leaves into thin strips and finely chop the waterleaf or spinach. If using frozen or dried afang leaves, rehydrate them in warm water before slicing.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Blend the pepper (Scotch bonnet or chili peppers) to your desired level of spiciness. Be cautious with the quantity, as it can be quite hot.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">In a large pot, heat the palm oil until it becomes clear and slightly translucent. Be careful not to overheat and burn the oil.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Add chopped onions to the hot palm oil and sauté until they become translucent. Add the blended pepper and continue to sauté for a few minutes until the oil separates from the pepper.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Stir in the ground crayfish, garlic, ginger, bouillon cubes, and salt. This step enhances the flavor of the soup.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Add the cooked proteins and enough water or stock to create the desired consistency of the soup. Let the soup simmer for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Gently stir in the sliced afang leaves, followed by the chopped waterleaf (or spinach). Continue to cook for an additional 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are tender but not overcooked.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">If you're using utazi leaves, add them to the soup for an extra layer of flavor. You can also add periwinkle if desired, and cook for a few more minutes.</li>
		      <li class="steps-list-items">Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed by adding more salt or bouillon cubes. Once the vegetables are cooked and the soup is well-seasoned, your Afang soup is ready to be served.</li>
